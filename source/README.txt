Mouse Look Toggle for Rift MMO.

Website:

  http://fabd.github.io/rift-mouselook-addon/


How to Install:

  - Download and install Autohotkey from http://www.autohotkey.com/

  - Extract contents of this archive to your RIFT Addons folder
  
  - Double click the MouseLookToggle.ahk to run the Autohotkey script
  
  - Start the game, and enable the "Mouse Look Toggle" Addon
    (note there is the Addon *AND* the Autohotkey scripts, both work together)


Notes:

  * The MouseLookToggle.ahk (Autohotkey) script is included in the archive
    for convenience to have just one download. You can move the Autohotkey
    script wherever you like.

  * Both the script and the addon are required to work properly. The addon
    communicates with the Autohotkey script by setting a few pixels in one
    corner of the screen. The Addon tells Autohotkey when to turn off
    Mouse Look for a better integration in the game.

  * Whenever the chat window is moved (or you switch to a character using
    a different UI), you have to restart the script (right click the "H"
    Autohotkey icon in the tray and select "Reload This Script"). You will
    notice if you forget to do so that you can not press F or use the TAB
    key while typing in chat. Restarting the script should fix this.
